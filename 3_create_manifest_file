#In this script, you will: 
##### 1. Create a manifest file for downstream analyses of sequencing data with QIIME2 version 2021.11.0.
##### 2. Import each paired-end sequence using QIIME2. Check the per-sample sequence counts.


# to load my conda stack (with fastqc and multiqc) use the following command:
###### module load conda
###### module use /fs1/home/embury/sstack/rhel_8/stacks/conda



# 1. Create a manifest file for downstream analyses of sequencing data with QIIME2 version 2021.11.0. 

#To make a manifest file we need the file location for each forward and reverse sequencing files. 

#Find and save into a .txt file the file path to each forward (R1) & reverse (R2) sequence in the directory.

find /fs1/home/embury/Jornada_bacteria/Romero-Olivares_Project_002-fastqs/*L001_R1*.fastq.gz -type f > Forwardlist.txt

find /fs1/home/embury/Jornada_bacteria/Romero-Olivares_Project_002-fastqs/*L001_R2*.fastq.gz -type f > Reverselist.txt

###### Forwardlist.txt and Reverselist.txt are in: /fs1/home/embury/Jornada_bacteria

#Download the 'Forwardlist.txt' and 'Reverselist.txt' files into your local PC. 
#Open a new Excel spreadsheet and label the first 3 columns as 'sample-id', 'forward-absolute-filepath', and 'reverse-absolute-filepath'. 
#Paste the file paths from the 'Forwardlist.txt' and 'Reverselist.txt' files into its respective column. 
#Write in the sample ID for each paired-end sequence. After 3 rows, Excel will automatically fill in the rest of the column. 
#Make sure that the sample ID matches the forward and reverse columns.
#Delete any undetermined samples from the manifest file.

#Save the manifest file as 'original-manifest-file.txt' (tab delimited) in Excel. Once saved, change the file extension to *.tsv

##Example of Manifest file: 

#sample-id	forward-absolute-filepath	                                        reverse-absolute-filepath

#As you can see, the paths to the forward and reverve files for each sample is listed in the Manifest file. 



# 2. Import each paired-end sequence using QIIME2. Check the per-sample sequence counts.

## download qiime2

module load conda
module use /fs1/home/embury/sstack/rhel_8/stacks/conda
wget https://data.qiime2.org/distro/core/qiime2-2023.7-py38-linux-conda.yml
conda env create -n qiime2-2023.7 --file qiime2-2023.7-py38-linux-conda.yml

###### to activate qiime:

conda activate qiime2-2023.7
        

#Make a directory where the output will go.

mkdir /fs1/home/embury/Jornada_bacteria/ITSextracted

#Import the paired-end sequences using the manifest file

qiime tools import \
--type 'SampleData[PairedEndSequencesWithQuality]' \
--input-path /fs1/home/embury/Jornada_bacteria/original-manifest-file.tsv \
--output-path /fs1/home/embury/Jornada_bacteria/ITSextracted/paired_end_demux_reverse.qza \
--input-format PairedEndFastqManifestPhred33V2

#If this runs well, then your sequences were imported and you will have a 'paired_end_demux_reverse.qza' file.
    

#Before trimming, examine the per-sample sequence counts in the 'paired_end_demux_reverse.qza' file.
#This is critical as it will show if there are samples with low sequence counts to exclude. 
#If you do not exclude low count sequences you will get a "file too small" error when extracting the ITS2 region.

#First, create a .qzv file. 

qiime demux summarize \
--i-data /fs1/home/embury/Jornada_bacteria/ITSextracted/paired_end_demux_reverse.qza \
--o-visualization /fs1/home/embury/Jornada_bacteria/ITSextracted/paired_end_demux_reverse.qzv

#Download the 'paired_end_demux_reverse.qzv' output file into the local PC.
#Upload and view the 'paired_end_demux_reverse.qzv' file on https://view.qiime2.org 

#The visualization of 'paired_end_demux_reverse.qzv' shows several samples with low sequence counts. 
#Download the 'Per-sample sequence counts' table and sort from low to high values.
#From the manifest file remove samples with low per sequence counts. 
#Save the file as 'manifest_file_good_pair_reads.tsv'.
    

## In this project, I had 0 samples were too few reads so I will use the original manifest file
    ## if low sample counts need to be removed, create a new manifest file and repeat the "qiime tools import" step.


#If this runs well, then your sequences were imported and you will have a 'paired_end_demux_reverse.qza' file.
