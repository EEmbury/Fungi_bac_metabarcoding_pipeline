# Check md5 values to ensure proper data download

    # The sequencing facility will provide an md5sum file. After downloading the sequence files, md5sum values must be generated 
    # and compared to the md5sum values from the sequencing facility. Values should be identical. 
    # If values are not identical, an error may have occured in the download process

## upload files onto workspace, on the HPC Discovery Cluster this can be done through the OnDemand file browser

## if files were uploaded in zipped folder, unzip the folder
gzip filename.zip

## individual sequence files ending with .fastq.gz should now be available

## check the md5sum file from the sequencing facility and ensure that the names of the files in the document match exactly.
    ## if they are not identical the md5sums will be different

## generate md5sum values

md5sum *.fastq.gz > checkmd5.out

## use "diff" to compare the md5sum you made and the md5sum from the sequencing facility

diff --report-identical-files --ignore-space-change  <(sort checkmd5.out) <(sort md5.edit.txt) > compare_md5.txt

###### output = "Files /dev/fd/63 and /dev/fd/62 are identical"
