# Generate quality reports of raw paired-end sequences.

# THE FOLLOWING CODE AND TEXT IS BASED UPON: https://github.com/adriluromero/Jornada_DxD_fungal_metabarcoding/blob/main/1_Initial_quality_reports.txt 


## 1. Generate fastqc reports on the quality of the '.fastq.gz' files.
## 2. Use multiqc to compile the data from all individual fastqc reports into one report. 


## 1. Generate fastqc reports on the quality of the '.fastq.gz' files.

# install fastqc and multiqc in conda
# I was working on the NMSU HPC Discovery Cluster and therefore could not directly download fastqc and multiqc

sstack install -n myconda -t conda                       ### installs a personal conda stack
module load conda                                        ### load conda
conda activate /fs1/home/embury/sstack/rhel_8/modules    ### use your personal conda stack

    conda install -c bioconda fastqc     ### install packages
    conda install -c bioconda multiqc

## Generate fastqc reports for all files with a '.fastq.gz' extension.
fastqc /fs1/home/embury/Jornada_bacteria/Romero-Olivares_Project_002-fastqs/*.fastq.gz

## Make a directory where these files will go
mkdir /fs1/home/embury/Jornada_bacteria/QC

## Since these reports are pre-trimming, create a 'pre-trim' directory for the reports.
mkdir /fs1/home/embury/Jornada_bacteria/QC/pre-trim

## Move the individual fastqc reports to the pre-trim directory
mv /fs1/home/embury/Jornada_bacteria/Romero-Olivares_Project_002-fastqs/*fastqc* /fs1/home/embury/Jornada_bacteria/QC/pre-trim


## 4. Use multiqc to compile the data from all individual fastqc reports into one report.

## A single multiqc report makes it easier to view information on all of your files. For example, cheking for adapter content across files. 

## Make a directory where the files will go 
mkdir /fs1/home/embury/Jornada_bacteria/QC/pre-trim/multiqc

## Run multiqc
multiqc /fs1/home/embury/Jornada_bacteria/QC/pre-trim -o /fs1/home/embury/Jornada_bacteria/QC/pre-trim/multiqc

## Set the -o flag to the directory where you'd like to save the multiqc report.  

# unload conda when done
module unload conda
