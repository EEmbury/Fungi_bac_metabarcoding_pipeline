### to upload data to NCBI it needs to be in fasta format. I was given fastq format.

### restructure data into fasta using sed

for file in *.fastq; do
  sed -n '1~4s/^@/>/p;2~4p' "$file" > "$file.fasta"
done


### this above code added .fasta but did not remove the .fastq. The following code removes the .fastq

for f in *.fastq.fasta; do
    mv -- $f ${f/.fastq/}
done
